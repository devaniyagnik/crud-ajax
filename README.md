# AJAX CRUD Operations

This project demonstrates a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) for making HTTP requests to a server.

## Features

- Create new items using AJAX POST requests.
- Read and display a list of items using AJAX GET requests.
- Update existing items using AJAX PUT/PATCH requests.
- Delete items using AJAX DELETE requests.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project locally, make sure you have the following:

- Web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) or a local development environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP).
- Text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) for editing code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

2. Place the project files inside your web server's document root directory or the appropriate directory for your local development environment.

3. Open the project files in your text editor or IDE.

4. Set up a server-side script or API endpoint to handle the CRUD operations. This could be a server-side language like PHP, Node.js, or any other backend technology of your choice.

5. Update the AJAX requests in the project files (e.g., JavaScript files) to point to the correct API endpoints or server-side scripts.

6. Start your web server or local development environment.

Open your browser and navigate to the appropriate URL to see the app running.

## Technologies Used
JavaScript: Programming language for making AJAX requests and manipulating the DOM.
HTML: Markup language for creating the user interface.
CSS: Stylesheet language for styling the user interface.
